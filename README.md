# AI-Based Threat Detection System

A web-based AI-powered threat detection system that integrates PE header analysis for `.exe` files, URL threat checks, file hash lookups, and extension verification. Designed for fast, reliable detection to support cybersecurity analysis and threat mitigation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **PE Header-Based `.exe` File Analysis**  
  Detects malicious Windows executable files using a machine learning model (Random Forest) trained on PE header features.

- **URL Safety Checker**  
  Analyzes URLs for phishing, malware, or suspicious behavior using the VirusTotal API.

- **File Hash Analysis**  
  Checks file hashes against known malware databases (like VirusTotal).

- **File Extension Verification**  
  Identifies spoofed or mismatched file extensions to catch hidden threats.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Random Forest)  
- **Libraries/Tools:** PEfile, hashlib, requests, pandas
